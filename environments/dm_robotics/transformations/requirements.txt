# dm_transformations pip dependencies.
# It's preferable to:
# (a) have a set of possible versions for each package that is limited, to
#     reduce the set of valid configurations and reduce the probability that one
#     is failing.
# (b) be resilient to library changes. In particular, we do not want to bump to
#     the next major version of a library without knowing.
# (c) get the bug-fixes. However, it's dependent on each package versionning
#     scheme (e.g. it would be safe to upgrade the patch version in
#     [major].[minor].[patch] for https://semver.org/).
#
# Thus, prefer "==". If you do want (c), you can use the ~= construct.
