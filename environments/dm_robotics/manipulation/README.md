# Objects for robotic manipulation

This folder provides various physical objects and software utilities used to
build simulated environments for robotic manipulation.

#### Cell for robotic manipulation
Contains assets and code to create a robotic cell in simulated environments.

#### Parametric objects documentation
Infrastructure to design families of parametric objects.

#### [RGB-objects &#128721;&#129001;&#128311; documentation](props/rgb_objects/README.md)
Contains assets and supported code that allows using the RGB-objects in
simulated environments. The RGB-objects is a set of parametric objects crafted
for [RGB-stacking][rgb_stacking] manipulation tasks.
