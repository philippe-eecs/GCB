// A hierarchical least-squares Quadratic Optimization solver for stacks of
// affine tasks and constraints. Abstract interfaces are provided for the tasks
// and constraints that the solver takes as inputs.
//
// In every hierarchy, solves the following least squares optimization problem:
//   argmin_x Sum_i w_i || M_i x - b_i ||^2;
//   subject to l_j <= C_j x <= u_j  for all j
// where w_i, M_i, and b_i are the weight, coefficient matrix, and bias of the
// i-th task, respectively; and C_j, l_j, and u_j are the coefficient matrix,
// lower bound, and upper bound for the j-th constraint, respectively.
//
// The tasks of each hierarchy are projected to the remaining hierarchies as a
// nullspace projection constraint of the form:
//   M_null x_sol - e_slack <= M_null x <= M_null x_sol + e_slack
// where M_null are the stacked coefficient matrices of the tasks in the
// previous hierarchy with enabled nullspace projection, x_sol is the solution
// from the previous hierarchy, and e_slack is a slack added to make the
// hierarchical projection numerically stable.
//
// The internal QP solver (OSQP) is used to iterate on the resulting
// optimization problem from each hierarchy until it is solved or the maximum
// number of iterations is reached. The optimization problem will be considered
// solved if a set of decision variables is found such that the infinity norm of
// the primal and dual residuals of the resultant QP problem are within the
// specified tolerances. Note that task weights higher (lower) than `1.0`
// effectively tighten (loosen) the tolerance of the optimization problem.
// Please refer to OSQP's algorithm publication for more information:
// https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08013.pdf
//
// Solutions are returned in the form of an absl::Span<const double> object,
// which represents a view over the solution array. It is the user's
// responsibility to ensure that the view remains valid while it is being used.
// If a copy is desired, we recommend the use of the function `AsCopy` defined
// in the utils.h header in the same directory as this file.
