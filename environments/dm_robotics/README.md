## Installation
These libraries are distributed on PyPI, the packages are:

*  `dm_robotics-transformations`
*  `dm_robotics-geometry`
*  `dm_robotics-vision`
*  `dm_robotics-agentflow`
*  `dm_robotics-manipulation`
*  `dm_robotics-moma`
*  `dm_robotics-controllers`

Python versions 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 are supported.

## Dependencies
`MoMa`, `Manipulation` and `Controllers` depend on MuJoCo, the other packages do not.
See the individual packages for more information on their dependencies.

## Building

To build and test the libraries, run `build.sh`.  This script assumes:

*  MuJoCo is installed.
*  [`dm_control`](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control) is installed.
*  cmake version >= 3.20.2 is installed.
*  Python 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 and system headers are installed.
*  GCC version 9 or later is installed.
*  numpy is installed.

The Python libraries are tested with `tox`, the C++ code is built and tested
with `cmake`.

Tox's `distshare` mechanism is used to share the built source distribution
packages between the packages.
