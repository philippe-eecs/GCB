# GCB
GCB Codebase, Work In Progress
The original codebase was split between 4 different repos (mostly because the pybullet simulator is a lot of work to put together), working on merging them together.

For the GCB code, go into goalbisim folder
Working on moving the launch scripts in so you may launch GCB and collect offline data.
